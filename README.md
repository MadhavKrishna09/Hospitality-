## Description

This project aims to provide actionable insights into hospitality data through interactive dashboards.  The dashboards cover various aspects of the business, such as occupancy rates, revenue analysis, guest demographics, and more.  They are designed to be user-friendly and provide a clear overview of the data.

## Data Source

(Specify the data source used for the dashboards.  For example:)

* Sample hospitality dataset (CSV file)
* Data extracted from a specific database (e.g., SQL Server, Excel) - If so, name the source.
* Data from a specific API (if applicable).

(If the data is publicly available, provide a link to it. If it's not publicly available, you can mention how it was collected or generated.)

## Dashboards

(Describe the dashboards included in the project and the insights they provide.  For example:)

* **Occupancy Dashboard:** Visualizes occupancy rates over time, broken down by room type or other relevant categories.  Provides insights into peak seasons and low occupancy periods.
* **Revenue Dashboard:** Analyzes revenue trends, including revenue by room type, revenue per available room (RevPAR), and other key revenue metrics.
* **Guest Demographics Dashboard:**  Provides insights into guest demographics, such as age, location, and booking source.
* **(Add other dashboards and their descriptions here)**

(If possible, include screenshots of the dashboards in the README.  This makes the project much more appealing and understandable.)

## How to Use

1. **Download the Power BI file:**  Download the `.pbix` file from the repository.
2. **Open in Power BI Desktop:** Open the downloaded `.pbix` file using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
3. **Interact with the dashboards:**  Use the interactive features of the dashboards to explore the data, filter by different criteria, and drill down for more detailed information.  (Mention specific interactive features if relevant, like slicers, tooltips, etc.)
4. **(Optional) Refresh the data:** If the data source is dynamic, you may need to refresh the data within Power BI Desktop to see the latest information. (Explain how to do this if needed).
